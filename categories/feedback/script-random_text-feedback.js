    "Never emotional.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Wait. Go for a walk, wait one day, calm down and think of the actual content of that feedback. What is it that made you mad? Focus on the facts and write them down - it will help.</span>",

    "Better sooner than later.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Do not wait too long as the feedback may be outdated and not relevant anymore.</span>",

    "Not only when asked.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Just go and give that feedback now, don’t wait. That will allow the feedback receiver to improve his/her quality of work now - not in 3 months’ time.</span>",

    "Give it in person.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Sitting in front of the other person and telling them what are the improvement areas in their work is super hard, but makes the biggest difference.</span>",

    "Talk about facts and give examples.<br><br><span class='more_text'><i>Your behaviour on the calls is always unprofessional</i> - this is not feedback, this is simply an opinion. <i>During the last call with the client you used offensive language and you did not prepare the demo you were supposed to show. This made me feel anxious and the client might have taken it as unprofessional. Next time, try not to use such words and reserve some time to prepare.</i> - sounds better, right? Also, avoid phrases such as: <i>always, never, usually</i> - instead list the exact situations.</span>",

    "Give real life advice.<br><br><span class='more_text'>If you see that someone is struggling with time management, try to not only highlight it in your feedback, but give suggestions about how to improve it in the future. Try to be helpful: listing areas to improve without any proper advice on HOW to improve them won’t make a difference.</span>",

    "Talk about emotional reactions.<br><br><span class='more_text'>If someone is acting in a way that makes you feel undermined do not tell them that they are being arrogant - tell them that their actions make you feel left out and list those actions. That person may simply not see that there are such reactions to their behaviours. However, remember that they’re not responsible for your emotions - you are. Make sure not to blame them, simply list areas to improve.</span>",

    "Adjust your feedback to the current situation.<br><br><span class='more_text'>There are different types of feedback and it is important not to mix them and understand the difference between appreciation, coaching, and evaluation: 1) Appreciation is focused on motivating, encouragement. 2) Coaching it is about showing the direction of how you can increase your skills and grow. 3) Evaluation tells you where you are and what are the expectations towards you.</span>",

    "Help others work on what's in their blind spot.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Each of us has a set of behaviours that may have a negative impact on others and we do not know or realise that we have them - this is the blind spot.</span>",

    "Give feedback on the go.<br><br><span class='more_text'>Whenever you see that they are doing the undesirable thing, tell them, right there, right now - they will be grateful, and they will be able to understand the factors that cause that behaviour.</span>",
