# Good Manager

**Good Manager** is a new-tab replacement extension for Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)) and acts as a simple way to motivate me to be a better manager by randomly showing specific quotes/phrases from 5 categories.

## Categories 

- Behaviors,
- What To Say,
- Feedback,
- Quotes,
- 10 Things That Require Zero Talent.

<!-- ![Example](https://i.ibb.co/j6nZV2G/Be-Funky-collage.jpg) -->

## See for yourself!

**Good Manager** can be:
1) [accessed here](https://vardecab.github.io/good-manager/chooser.html) as a normal website or... 
2) you can download latest `.zip` from [_Releases_](https://github.com/vardecab/good-manager/releases)  (_alternatively, you can pack files from this repo into `.zip` yourself_) and manually add as an extension to Google Chrome or Vivaldi. By doing that, any time you open a new tab - Good Manager will load.
