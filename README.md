# Good Manager

>**Good Manager** is a new-tab replacement extension for Chromium-based browsers (eg Google Chrome, [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)) and acts as a simple way to motivate me to be a better manager by randomly showing specific quotes/phrases from several categories.

### Categories

- Behaviors,
- What To Say,
- Feedback,
- Quotes,
- 10 Things That Require Zero Talent,
- Working Remotely.

## How to use

**Good Manager** can be:
1) [accessed here](https://vardecab.github.io/good-manager/chooser.html) as a normal website or... 
2) you can download latest `.zip` from [_Releases_](https://github.com/vardecab/good-manager/releases)  (_alternatively, you can pack files from this repo into `.zip` yourself_) and manually add as an extension to your Chromium-based browser. By doing that, any time you open a new tab - Good Manager will load.

### Magical bulb ðŸ’¡

Clicking the bulb (ðŸ’¡) will load new quote/text from random category. 

Refreshing the page (F5/âŒ˜+R) will load a quote/text from the same category you're currently viewing.
